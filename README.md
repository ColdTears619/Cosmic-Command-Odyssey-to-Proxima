## 💻 Technical Overview

This project is a C# console mini-game that I built to practice and reinforce the fundamentals I’ve learned so far — things like arrays, strings, random numbers, and exception handling.
It’s part of my journey to move from basic C# syntax toward building structured and logical programs.

## 🧩 What I’m doing Here

- Using methods to organize the game logic
- Applying switch and conditional statements
- Working with Random to generate events
- Managing turns and game states manually
- Designing readable and maintainable console output

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open it in Visual Studio or VS Code with C# extension.
3. Run the console app and follow the prompts to play.
