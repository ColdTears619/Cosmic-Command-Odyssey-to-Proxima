# Cosmic-Command-Odyssey-to-Proxima
Survive. Lead. Defy the unknown.

In a distant galaxy, your ship drifts between fading stars — its crew, six specialists from different worlds, bound by one mission: survive the next 10 turns.
Each cycle brings unpredictable events — solar flares, alien signals, system failures, or moral decisions that test your judgment. The survival of the ship depends on your ability to assign the right role to the right crisis… before time runs out.

🛰️ Roles on Board

Engineer – repairs the unrepairable.

Pilot – charts paths through chaos.

Scientist – deciphers alien anomalies.

Medic – protects life.

Security Officer – holds the line.

Commander (You) – makes the final call.

⚙️ Gameplay Overview

## 💻 Technical Overview

This project is a C# console mini-game that I built to practice and reinforce the fundamentals I’ve learned so far — things like arrays, strings, random numbers, and exception handling.
It’s part of my journey to move from basic C# syntax toward building structured and logical programs.

## 🧩 What I’m doing Here

- Using methods to organize the game logic
- Applying switch and conditional statements
- Working with Random to generate events
- Managing turns and game states manually
- Designing readable and maintainable console output

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open it in Visual Studio or VS Code with C# extension.
3. Run the console app and follow the prompts to play.
